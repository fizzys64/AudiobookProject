Book: *The Princess and the Goblin* 

I am team Goblin I am going to be making an interactive audiobook for The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald. The tale follows a princess and a cast of goblins who hate poetry. 

For this project, I have hopes to make an interactive audiobook similar to Webtoons that have background music and voice acting while also being easy to follow as it is a children's fairy tale.
